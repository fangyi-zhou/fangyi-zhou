## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fangyi (they/them).
I am interested in programming languages, functional programming, type systems,
proof assistants, concurrency, distributed systems, and many more.

## What I've done in the past (professionally)
- I worked on refined multiparty session types, a typing
    discipline for safe message-passing concurrency with guarantees in data
    properties. You can find my thesis
    [here](https://fangyi.io/assets/phd-thesis.pdf).
- I worked as an applied scientist to build a static analyser for TypeScript.
- I worked as a full-stack software engineer for an LLM application.
- I worked as a software engineer intern to build new language features in
    [Hack](https://hacklang.org/).
